 *
 * CONVERT COORDINATES BETWEEN LATITUDE/LONGITUDE AND THE UTM/UPS GRIDS
 *
 * Stephen Fegan, July 2005, sfegan@gmail.com
 *
 * These conversion routines are a C/C++ implementation of the algorithms
 * described in the Defense Mapping Agency Technical Manual (DMATM) 8358.2
 * which is available from the US National Geospatial Mapping Agency.
 * At time of writing it could be downloaded at:
 *
 * http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/coordsys/csat_pubs.html
 *
 * A number of alternative conversion routines are available on the Web. Those
 * that I've seen are (ultimately) based on John Snyder's algorithm, presented
 * in "MAP PROJECTIONS; A WORKING MANUAL", USGS Professional Paper 1395. My
 * reading of that work suggests that Snyder's algorithms was derived as an
 * approximation to the original DMA algorithms.
 *
 * I have made every effort to make sure that this implementation is correct.
 * The "main" at the end of this file reproduces the worked examples in the
 * DMA document (section 2-11, page 2-7) to the accuracy of the equations
 * (0.01 meter on the grid and 0.001 arc second for geographic coordinates).
 * However, I DO NOT GIVE ANY ASSURANCES THAT THE OUTPUT OF THIS CODE IS
 * CORRECT. If you need this code for mission critical applications it
 * is your responsibility to ensure its accuracy to the degree you require.
 *
 * The variable names may seem cryptic, but they were chosen to reflect the
 * DMA algorithm and to make the code writing easier.
 *
 * There only adjustable parameter is the tolerance to which the iteration
 * to find the true meridional distance is performed in the reverse
 * calculation. It is set at 0.001 meter which exceeds the accuracy the DMA
 * claims across the range of applicability of the series. A lower value is
 * only meaningful if you are working close to the meridian.
 *
 * This code is in C++ but the main conversion routines should work without
 * modification under a C compiler. The "main" test code will need some
 * reworking to compile under C.
 *
 * I do not regard this work is anything other than a simple translation of
 * the DMA algorithms, which were released as "Distribution Unlimited".
 * Although I am a strong supporter of the GPL and free software, I do not
 * think it would be appropriate to release this code under the GPL since
 * all the hard work was done by the DMA and was unconditionally released to
 * the public. Therefore this code is released into the public domain.
 *
 * I request, however, that if you distribute the source, or a modification,
 * that you leave this header intact and that you leave the test "main" code
 * attached so that others can verify the code reproduces the DMA examples.
