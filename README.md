### The name ###

__calin__ is a (French) word that my three-year-old daughter says a
  lot. Here it isn't meant to mean anything specific, but to evoke the
  word "calibration". Since acronyms abound in astronomy it could at a
  stretch stand for "calibration and analysis for large IACT
  networks", but that wasn't the original motivation.
