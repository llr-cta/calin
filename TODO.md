# NectarCAM

* Add decode of FEB charges in R1 format
* Calibration
  - pulse shape (elec, flash, mirror)
  - spe
  - excess variance fraction
  - elec noise
  - rel gain
  - abs gain
  - muon
  - high/low
* Cuts on mean trace gustos
* pedestal and gain to WF treatment
* Trigger calib plots into stage 1
* Photo-statistics plots to S1
* Histogram of number of channels
* Run duration estimation when no UCTS
* Implement pedestal distribution model
* Speed up histograms
* Cleaning & Hillas parameters
* Count busy triggers

# Simulations

* Add some electronics simulation
* Finish them !!
